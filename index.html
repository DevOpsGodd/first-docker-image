        <h3>I am Uthman Abdul-Lateef</h3>
        <p>I am a practicing Devops Engineer and an open source enthusiast,
            I have a passion for streamlining and automating software development processes 
            to improve the efficiency and quality of software delivery.
            
            My expertise lies in designing and implementing continuous integration
             and delivery pipelines, monitoring and logging systems, and infrastructure 
            as code solutions. I have experience working with a range of DevOps tools and 
            technologies such as Jenkins, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS, and Azure.
            
            In my spare time, I enjoy exploring new DevOps tools and technologies,
             contributing to open-source projects, and sharing my knowledge with the
             community through talks and blogs.
            
         
            <br>
            I'm excited to connect with other like-minded individuals in the DevOps community,
            so feel free to reach out to me! Let's collaborate and build something awesome together.
